        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The MyNM app serves as a mobile portal for patients to manage their healthcare through the MyChart platform. However, the original mobile experience was unintuitive, visually outdated, and lacked consistency with the desktop version. As the UX designer and researcher on this project, I led the redesign effort to modernize the app, improve usability, and ensure feature parity with MyChartâ€™s core capabilities.

        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
        The original MyNM app posed several usability and functionality challenges:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Navigation was confusing and unintuitive.
            </li>
            <li>
                The design felt outdated and inconsistent with current UX standards.
            </li>
            <li>
                The app's structure and layout differed significantly from the desktop MyChart experience, confusing users who relied on both platforms.
            </li>
            <li>
               Essential features like the **Health Feed** (a stream of upcoming appointments, to-dos, and health reminders) and access to MyChart activities (e.g., test results, appointment scheduling) were missing entirely. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        Our team also faced significant constraints:
                <ul>
            <li>
               Limited development resources** and only two UX designers.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was solely responsible for design and testing efforts, with one teammate assisting by taking notes during testing sessions.
            </li>
            <li>
              A tight 7-month timeline to complete the entire redesign.
            </li>
        </ul>
